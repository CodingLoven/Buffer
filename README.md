I cloned this website "buffer.com" 
I started it since december and finished it on the 15th of january
I improvised on some aspects on it as i did not use any javascript for the website
I made use of just HTML and CSS 
This website was given to my by one of my tutor to test how fervent i am in html css before moving on 
I was not really at my best while working on it but yeah i did what has to be done and get it finished!
